The old man looks at you, but his eyes seem to be looking through you.
After a unpleasantly long pause, he asks:
    "Well young man, what do you say?"

Who are you?=who,
Screw this old guy. I have things to do.=exit

$$$notsure
The old man laughs at you. He asks:
    "Why would you say that?"

$$$who
The old man leans back a bit and his eyes sparkle with mirth.
Suddenly, he moves with almost supernatural speed, getting right in your face.

    "DO YOU KNOW WHO I AM?" He booms
    "IM THE JUGGERNAUT..."
    "BITCH."
